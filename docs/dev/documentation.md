# Documentation

When updating features that a general user of the GREN Map DB Node may see, it should be documented in the `/user` section of the docs.

When updating features that a system administrator may use, it should be documented in the `/admin` section of the docs.

For code that may be novel, notable, non-obvious, or exemplary, documentation in the `/dev` section of the docs should be considered.

## Style and Conventions

We have adopted general guidelines in the [Google Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style) as a base.  We recommend looking for existing documentation similar to what is being written, and using that as a guide.

## Language

All documentation must be written at least in English.  Versions in other languages are optional.
